      <h2>Memory-corruption Attacks and ASLR</h2>
      <p>A key feature of the Meltdown paper is that it demonstrates how a side channel attack can prevent KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomisation)<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. This page
        introduces the concept of
        memory-corruption attacks and KASLR.</p>

      <p>All software, including the kernel, are susceptible to bugs, including those which lead to security vulnerabilities. The Linux kernel itself had 453 security vulnerabilities published on the
        CVE database in 2017<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. In the operation of a computer, instructions are read from memory to be executed. Therefore, kernel memory attacks can be severe as
        attackers can cause malicious code
        to be executed in kernel mode by overwriting kernel memory, allowing any CPU instruction to be executed and all memory addresses to be referenced.</p>

      <p>One common example of a memory-corruption attack is using a buffer overflow vulnerability<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>, allowing an attacker writes data past a buffer's boundary in a
        vulnerable program to overwrite
        adjacent memory locations. The adjacent memory location could be a return address for a function which could be overwritten by an attacker to point to the attacker's code written elsewhere
        into memory. Fortunately, executable space protection allows user-writable pages to be marked as non-executable, causing a targeted process to crash if execution of user-writable memory is
        attempted.</p>

      <p>Executable space protection is insufficient as there are more complex methods to bypass this security defence such as return-oriented programming. Return-oriented programming (ROP) executes
        a sequence of instructions/functions already made available by the running program or shared library code in order to execute malicious code<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>. As executable code
        stored in memory by
        definition would not be marked as non-executable, ROP would not be prevented by executable space protection. If a ROP attack occurs in the kernel, the attacker could gain access to the entire
        system.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 1: Effect of ASLR on memory-oriented attacks</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Techniques such as return-oriented programming can be mitigated using ASLR and KASLR. For ROP attacks to work, the attacker needs to know the addresses of functions to be called as passing
        invalid addresses could lead to the running process crashing. ASLR randomly distributes core parts of processes (base address, libraries, stack pointers, etc.) in virtual memory so that
        attackers are forced to predict the addresses<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>. KASLR adds to this by randomising the kernel's location in memory when the system boots, making addresses
        unpredictable for attackers and
        therefore preventing ROP attacks.</p>
