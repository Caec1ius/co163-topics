      <h1>Performance Improvements</h1>
      <p>
        The fetching of data from main memory in the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle takes a
        comparatively large amount of time as compared to the rest of the cycle. When a program
        depends on the fetching of an uncached value in main memory, it may take several hundred
        clock cycles before the value is returned. Rather than wasting these cycles by idling,
        processors implement instruction-level parallelism through pipelining. The purpose of
        pipelining is to keep every module of the processor busy with some instruction with the
        aim of increasing instruction throughput. Ideally the pipeline aims to execute one fetch
        instruction per cycle; if this is achieved, the processor is said to be ‘fully pipelined’.
        In order to maximise performance, modern high-speed processors utilise various optimisation
        techniques to reduce the idle wait time; two of these methods are Branch Prediction and
        Speculative Execution.
      </p>
      <h2>Branch Prediction</h2>
      <p>
        A Branch Predictor is a digital circuit whose purpose is to guess which branch of a
        conditional statement will be taken before the true branch is known.  They play a
        critical role in flow improvement within the instruction pipeline and in maximising
        processor performance.
        The first time a conditional jump instruction is encountered the branch predictor has
        little information to use, however the branch predictor holds a record (Branch Target
        Buffer – BTB) of which branches are taken each time. In the case that it encounters a
        conditional jump that has been seen multiple times it can then make a prediction based
        on past results. The prediction could either be based on patterns such as that a
        particular branch is taken every other time or that it is simply taken more often than not.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a two-level adaptive branch predictor will hold a 2-bit saturating
        counter for each branch, to rate the likelihood of it being taken. These counters
        are stored in a Pattern History Table where every entry represents a 2-bit
        saturating counter of the type shown in figure 1. When a branch is evaluated, it’s
        counter will be updated.

      <h2>Speculative Execution</h2>
      <p>
        Speculative execution is a technique in which the processor will guess likely future execution
        paths - typically, but not limited to, via Branch Prediction - and attempt to prematurely
        execute them. After deciding on the execution path, the processor will save a checkpoint of
        its register state and proceed to speculatively execute the program via the chosen path. When
        the value eventually arrives from memory, the processor checks the correctness of its initial
        guess. If the guess was incorrect, the processor will rollback by reverting the register state
        back to the stored checkpoint, yielding no processing improvement as compared to idling. In
        the case that the guess was correct, however, the speculative execution results are committed,
        resulting in a significant performance increase.
