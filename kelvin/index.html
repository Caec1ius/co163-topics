        <p>Hi, I’m an aspiring software engineer and student from London, UK. I study MEng Computing (Artificial Intelligence) at Imperial College London.</p>

        <p>If you’re a recruiter, take a look at my <a href="assets/Kelvin%20Zhang%20-%20CV.pdf">CV</a>. You can also find more details about me and my projects below. I also post on my <a href="https://iamkelv.in/blog/">blog</a> every now and then. Also, check out my <a href="https://github.com/kz">GitHub</a>!</p>

        <p>You can get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:hello@iamkelv.in">email</a> or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/KelvZhan">@KelvZhan</a>. Other places to find me: <a href="https://keybase.io/kz">Keybase</a> (also to find my GPG key), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/KelvZhan/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/KelvZhan">Facebook</a> and IRC (KelvZhan on Freenode).</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>My main interest is software engineering. I have been programming from a young age, with most of my work being with web development, predominantly with the PHP framework, <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>. My interest in system software has developed over the past few years, building various projects with languages best suited to their use cases (including Python, Java and <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>).</p>

        <p>I also hold a casual interest in infosec. I love listening to talks, keeping up to date with recent events, and improving my own cybersecurity skills. I have also participated in bug bounties (including Facebook and eBay’s) and CTFs.</p>

        <p>A few of my specific current interests and projects:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Learning to build for scale (distributed systems), including taking a deep dive into architecture (Cassandra, Docker and so many other things!)</li>
          <li><a href="https://artificial.io/products">Insurtech</a> working at Artificial Labs to digitise a traditionally paper-based industry</li>
          <li>Finding ways to improve traditionally insecure DVRs by building <a href="https://github.com/kz/swanntools">my own software replacement</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I also quite regularly attend hackathons, so you may see me around at them. Outside of computing, I play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWNamssrZAY">fives</a> (squash, but with your hands!) and enjoy reading sci-fi novels.</p>
